        <td>To bring awareness for those who are suffering from mental illness that it is okay to seek help. It is also to inform the public the importance of educating about mental health. Just like cancer, mental illness deserves no discrimination. Many are suffering from mental health in one form or another, and because of the stigma attached to it, those who are suffering are not seeking help, because perhaps, they are ashamed as labeled to have mental illness, that they are weak and fragile. </td>

            This audience may lack personal devices or have difficulty with navigating the internet on a browser. There's also the matter of if these people can even utilize the services this website will provide.
        </td>
        <td>
            I'll want to make the website easily accessible to everyone regardless of age, gender, and special needs. I can add tools to accommodate people with disabilities &#40;blind/poor vision, deaf, motor control, etc&#41; that could hinder their online navigation experience. I should make the website easy to find for those who lack access to a personal browser device or are not familiar with navigating the internet. I'm also thinking I should make information and services readily available without unnecessary hassle.

            Abuse is a difficult subject to openly talk about. Victims feel apprehension when it comes to discussing their past and issues. They fear that they will be cruelly judged or seen as weak.
        </td>
        <td>
            I really need to stress and guarantee the safety of this audience. No one should be excluded from the services this website provides. Anyone can receive help without being judged for whatever issues they wish to discuss.

            Veterans may have the same fears as victims of abuse, but their trauma comes from a different place. Understanding this distinction could be crucial in fulfilling their needs.
        </td>
        <td>
            I want to take a similar approach as with abuse victims. I also think the website should show respect for veterans' services.
