    Mobile devices continue to be created throughout the world. As their numbers increase, businesses must consider how to expand their online presence through them. One question often comes up: Should the business be accompanied by a responsive mobile website or a downloadable application for mobile devices?

    A mobile website is exactly what it sounds like. It is the version of a website that is designed for smaller screens such as those on mobile devices. This is made possible because it is designed responsively. As Jason Summerfield of Human Service Solutions states, “responsive web design is becoming the new standard for websites that are not only mobile-friendly, but that can scale to any sized device - from desktop down to tablet and handheld smartphones. (Summerfield)” If you are going to develop a website for your business, a mobile version should be a given since it will require different layouts for other screen sizes. A mobile website will have the same functionality as its desktop version, so regular visitors should be familiar with how everything works. Mobile websites are easy to find over the internet and can be shared between users and publishers. They last indefinitely longer than mobile applications, and they can even become apps themselves. According to Jason Summerfield, “mobile websites can be developed as database-driven web applications that act very much like native apps. A mobile web application can be a practical alternative to native app development. (Summerfield)”

    Mobile applications, or app for short, are programs that can be downloaded and installed on a mobile device. They can work without an internet connection and they load faster than web pages. One particular advantage, stated by Mirko Humbert of Designer Daily, is that “The features of the apps and tools in the mobile phone can easily be integrated to give more significant results than mobile-oriented sites. (Humbert)” Another benefit mentioned by Jason Summerfield is push notifications: “An inherent capability of apps is the ability to send push notifications to users who have the app installed on their device, giving app publishers the ability to send messages to users directly. (Summerfield)” However, mobile apps take longer and cost more to develop. Businesses should consider if it is worth investing in one as opposed to a mobile website. According to Mirko Humbert, “Many organizations have mobile-optimized pages, and they do not need mobile apps to be successful despite them being more efficient than mobile-oriented sites. Many businesses have opted for the mobile-oriented site since they are less expensive as compared to developing an app. (Humbert)”
